            Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the
            model generates is valid JSON.

            **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON
            yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream
            of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and
            seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if
            `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the
            conversation exceeded the max context length.
